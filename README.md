# Hangman-Game
## Overview

    This is a basic Hangman game where the computer will generate a random word from a given array of words. The user then guesses a letter on his or her keyboard and the computer will tell you whether or not that letter is in the word.
Guessing
    Each time the user guesses a correct letter the computer will fill that letter into the word. When all correct letters are guessed and the word is complete, the computer will log your win and choose another random word and the game will start over.
    Each wrong guess will reduce your remaining guesses by one until you reach 0 guesses. The computer will then choose another random word and the game starts over.
